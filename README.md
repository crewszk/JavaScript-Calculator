# JavaScript Calculator v0.06

Used as practice for manipulating HTML documents with JavaScript, its a simple calculator with interactable buttons a working calculating interface.
It supports addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. As well as parenthesis operations.
Both integer and floating point operations work.

Work in progress. 

To-Do List:

- Additional period checking to not add leading 0 if number already exists
- Additional styling for button pressing, like highlighting while the mouse is clicked down on a button, possibly a darker/thicker border
- Add a side button to extend the calculator to be a scientific calculator with more operands like exponents, logorithms, trig functions, etc.
- Develop my own parser instead of using eval() function to support addition operands
